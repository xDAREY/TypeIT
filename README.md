# TypeIT
A mobile game test that tests your typing speed :)

It is a very simple project and the user does not need to worry much as it helps in building how fast they can type on a mobile device. Let us call it a mobile "mavins beacon".

# Components
It is actually divided into 2 components:
1. The welcome UI screen.
2. The test screen (which has four buttons TAKE-TEST, RESET, NEXT & DONE button).

* the take-test button starts the game once it is been clicked with the help of the onClickListener().
* the reset button restarts the entire activity meaning whatever has been typed will get cleared away, then you start again.
* the next button takes you to another activity if you do not like the current activity or you are done with the current activity.
* the done button closes the entire app if you have finished the test.

# Stack
It was built for the android OS using:
1. Java (Backend).
2. Android XML (frontend).

# Features
* A timer method was implemented to know how many seconds it took the user to finish the test.
* A getLength method was also implemented therefore whenever the user does not complete the sentence been displayed, the test & timer will keep running.
* many more.
